RIVAL FOR EDISON COMPANY.
Tesla Men in the Field--Have Grants
for Thirty-seven Miles of Subways.

  The Kings County Electric Light and Pow-
er Company is preparing to compete with 
the Edison Electric Light Company by
erecting an underground system of sub-
ways, thirty-seven miles in length. The
statement is made on the authority of
Charles Cooper, who says that he controls
the Tesla patents for Brooklyn, and that 
he will be able to furnish light and heat
at a very low rate.
  The Edison Company is at the present
time investing about $1,500,00 in the erec-
tion of a plant for Edison processes, which
were involved in order to meet the com-
petition made possible by the Tesla in-
ventions. Subway permits have already
been granted to the Kings County Company.
  Mr. Cooper also stated yesterday that
twelve miles of subway have already been
laid and contracts let for twenty-five miles
additional. Work will be begun on the lat-
est contracts next week. The company
has been capitalized at $1,000,000.
